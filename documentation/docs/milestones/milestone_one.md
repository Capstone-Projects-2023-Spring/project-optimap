# Feature List for Milestone Demos

2023 Fall

# Sec. 002 OptiMap

## Milestone Demo 1 (3-20-2023)

F: User accounts

R: user can login / create an account 

F: Routes

R: user can save routes, load saved routes

F: Location and Directions verification

R: entered addresses are verified via Maps API

R: entered locations and desired directions are provided via Maps API

R: successful continuous API calls to grab directions (Point A -> Point B)

## Milestone Demo 2 (4-3-2023)

F: Map View and live directions

R: interactive map view provides live directions & user location

F: Location specific time constraints

R: user can specify time spent at each location

R: user can specify arrival time at each location

F: Optimization Algorithim

R: algorithm can take in list of directions and return them, optimized  

R: update algorithm to account for time constraints

R: algorithm tells user if route isnâ€™t possible based on time constraints

F: Create and run route

R: Optimization algorithm to organize locations

## Milestone Demo 3 (4-17-2023)

F: Different modes of transportation

R: user can select between car, walking, or bikes

F: Gas efficiency specification

R: user can input MPG, preference for gas efficiency toggle

F: algorithm accounts for gas efficiency

R: if gas efficiency is determined important, algorithm re-calculates

F: Additional preferences (tolls, ferries, specific road avoidance)

R: update algorithm based on these restraints

R: user is notified if path is not possible based on restraints
