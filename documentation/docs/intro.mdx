# Introduction

OptiMap is a progressive web application developed using React JS. It ensures users get the most efficient route, minimizing distance and time to any location they plug into the app. The application is designed for mobile devices but is also accessible through the browser.

OptiMap takes users' login credentials and authenticates them before allowing access to the service. It uses a Firebase database & cloud service to store important information such as account usernames, passwords, saved routes and recent routes. The firebase platform’s versatility and ease of application makes it the optimal choice to store and manage data for OptiMap.

With the rise of product delivery programs, finding the most efficient route in a long list of locations becomes exceedingly important. In many other scenarios - such as planning a long trip with a friend or a plumber organizing his list of clients and locations - a service to optimize the route would be ideal. OptiMap targets this problem by allowing users to enter any number of locations as they would need and then finding the optimal path. The locations do not particularly have to be in “order”, as our app determines the best route based on all of the plugged-in locations.

The most efficient route depends on several key factors, such as location, time, distance, and other preferences such as avoiding highways. The app allows users to plug in any number of locations that they need to visit, as well as the amount of time they expect to spend at each location. OptiMap will rearrange the order in which destinations are traveled to give users the most efficient path and to allow them to properly plan their travel. Once a route has been optimized and created, users may save that route for future use.

Overall, OptiMap is a powerful and user-friendly application that can help users optimize their travel routes quickly and efficiently.
