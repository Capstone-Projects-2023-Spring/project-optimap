The app allows users to plug in any number of locations that they need to visit, as well as the amount of time they expect to spend at each location. Additionally, they may specify a time they need to finish the route. In order to assist users that plan on leaving on a specific time/day, OptiMap calls the API to find out traffic information. In doing so, the users can input the time they plan on leaving and get an optimal route in return. OptiMap will rearrange the order in which destinations are traveled to give users the most efficient path and to allow them to properly plan their travel. Once a route has been optimized and created, users may save that route for future use.
