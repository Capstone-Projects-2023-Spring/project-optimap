A typical user will log in and plug in as many locations as they want into the app after creating an account.

Users can further customize their trip by specifying the amount of time they expect to spend at each location. Our app will be able to update them on traffic times, create the most efficient route, and give them an overview of their trip in general. One of the main features is redirecting users to Google maps for the navigation itself. For example, a user may decide to use our app\u2019s default feature of optimizing trip by time and distance on X locations. They will first enter X locations, followed by clicking \u201cStart Trip\u201d. The user will be prompted to navigate to their first destination after seeing the freshly computed route. Simply tapping "Go" will redirect them to Google Maps where they can begin their navigation. The user will switch between OptiMap and Google Maps after reaching each location until they have finished their entire trip.
