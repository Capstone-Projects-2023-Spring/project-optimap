This process continues until all nodes are added from the user inputted list. Once that is complete, the list of locations will be reordered into the fastest path and then displayed to the user. Running dijkstras algorithm on our own  machine may not be feasable due to the large amounts of computations needed, to mitigate this issue our group will try to look for different APIs such as the google maps API or any other maps API that will allow us to utilize dijkstras algorithm with our weights on their servers.
